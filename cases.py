Sample Medical Cases for Devil's Advocate Multi-Agent System Demo

These cases are designed to demonstrate different types of diagnostic bias:
1. Anchoring bias - focusing on first symptoms
2. Confirmation bias - overemphasizing previous conditions
3. Availability bias - overweighting recent conditions
4. Overconfidence bias - making definitive diagnoses too quickly

Chief Complaint: Abdominal pain and nausea for 2 days

History of Present Illness:
- Patient reports sharp, intermittent abdominal pain starting 2 days ago
- Pain is localized to right lower quadrant initially, now more diffuse
- Associated with nausea and decreased appetite
- No vomiting, fever, or changes in bowel movements

Past Medical History:
- Appendectomy 3 years ago (successful, no complications)
- No other significant medical history

Physical Examination:
- Vital signs: BP 120/80, HR 88, Temp 98.6째F, RR 16
- Abdomen: Soft, non-tender, no rebound tenderness
- No masses or organomegaly
- Bowel sounds present and normal

This case demonstrates anchoring bias - the diagnostician may focus on the right lower quadrant pain and appendectomy history, potentially missing other causes of abdominal pain.""",
